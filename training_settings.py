    This class defines how the training protocol is going to be.
    This is, how variables change depending on different conditions (e.g. performance),
    and/or which tasks are going to be run.

    In this class 2 methods need to be implemented:
    - __init__
    - update_training_settings

    In __init__ all the variables that can modify the state of the training protocol
    must be defined.
    When a new subject is created, a new row is added to the data/subjects.csv file,
    with these variables and its values.

    The following variables are needed:
    - self.next_task
    - self.refractary_period
    - self.minimum_duration
    - self.maximum_duration
    In addition to these variables, all the necessary variables to modify the state
    of the tasks can be included.

    When a task is run the values of the variables are read from the json file.
    When the task ends, the values of the variables are updated in the json file,
    following the logic in the update method"""
